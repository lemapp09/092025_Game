  characterDescription: A mysterious figure unbound by time, Chronos exists simultaneously
    in past, present, and future. Attacks ripple harmlessly through him as he subtly
    shifts his temporal presence. His shield is a swirling vortex of chronological
    energy, capable of rewinding damage and nullifying threats.
