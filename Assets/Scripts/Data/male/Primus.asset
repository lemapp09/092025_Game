  characterDescription: The First Flame, Primus is a primordial entity born from
    the genesis of existence. He manifests as a being of pure, incandescent energy,
    wielding a colossal sword forged from a dying star. His every attack unleashes
    cosmic novas, scorching foes with absolute destructive power that ignores all
    forms of resistance. He can briefly become a super-nova, consuming everything
    around him.
