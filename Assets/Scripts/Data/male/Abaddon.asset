  characterDescription: The Destroyer of Worlds, Abaddon is an entity of pure annihilation.
    Wielding a black blade that drinks light and life, he consumes all in his path,
    leaving only void. His presence corrupts the environment, weakening all foes,
    and his ultimate power allows him to manifest a fragment of true oblivion, wiping
    out entire armies.
