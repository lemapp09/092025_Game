  characterDescription: The 'Mistress of Time,' Tempestia is a temporal anchor, capable
    of manipulating the flow of battle. Her epic power allows her to rewind the last
    few seconds of combat, negating all damage taken by herself and her allies, and
    resetting crucial cooldowns. This makes her incredibly difficult to defeat and
    invaluable in challenging encounters. She wears ancient, clockwork-infused armor
    that hums with temporal energy.
