  characterDescription: Though seemingly quiet, Thordis possesses an inner strength
    as immovable as a mountain. Wielding a two-handed hammer, she delivers powerful
    counter-attacks while maintaining an impenetrable defensive stance, often creating
    openings for her teammates. She wears practical, reinforced plate.
