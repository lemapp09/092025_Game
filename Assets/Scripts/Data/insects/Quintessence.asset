  characterDescription: An enigmatic, multi-faceted beetle believed to be woven from
    the fabric of reality itself, Quintessence embodies the ultimate support. It
    can mimic any support ability seen on the battlefield, reflecting it with amplified
    power, or create a temporary pocket dimension where allies are completely safe
    and their abilities recharge at an incredible rate.
