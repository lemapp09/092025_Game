  characterDescription: A grim and focused warrior, Kira prefers to let her blade
    do the talking. She moves with a predatory grace, striking with deadly precision
    before her enemies even know they are in danger. She is a testament to the old
    saying that a sharp mind is as important as a sharp sword.
