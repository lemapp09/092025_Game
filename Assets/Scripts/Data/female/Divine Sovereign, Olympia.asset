  characterDescription: The 'Apex of Divinity,' Olympia embodies supreme cosmic authority.
    Her mythic ability is a singular, overwhelming command that forces all enemies
    to kneel and cease all actions for a prolonged period, leaving them utterly vulnerable.
    During this time, her team gains immense buffs to all stats, and Olympia herself
    becomes a conduit for raw divine energy, capable of unleashing a single, devastating
    'Judgment' attack that can wipe out entire enemy forces. She is clad in pure
    golden, radiating light, wearing a crown of stars, and wields a scepter of ultimate
    power.
