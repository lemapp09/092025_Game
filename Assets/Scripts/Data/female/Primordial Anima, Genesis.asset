  characterDescription: The 'Architect of Existence,' Genesis is a fragment of the
    universal life force itself, manifesting as a protector. Her mythic power allows
    her to literally recreate portions of the timeline, preventing all fatal damage
    to herself and her entire team for a sustained period, effectively resetting
    crucial battle moments. She can also siphon the life force from enemies to heal
    allies, making her an unmovable and unkillable anchor. Her form is a majestic,
    crystalline being, wreathed in nebula and primordial light, wielding a staff
    that pulses with creation energy.
