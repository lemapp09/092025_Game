  characterDescription: The 'Shadow of the Cosmos,' Nyx is a mysterious entity from
    beyond mortal understanding. Her legendary ability allows her to tear fissures
    in reality, pulling all enemies into a void dimension where they take continuous
    damage and are completely unable to attack or use abilities, while her allies
    are buffed. She is a master of spatial manipulation and can instantly teleport
    across the battlefield to absorb threats. Her form is constantly shifting, shrouded
    in cosmic shadow and starlight, wearing armor that seems to absorb light.
