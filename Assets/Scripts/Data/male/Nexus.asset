  characterDescription: The fabric of reality made sentient, Nexus can manipulate
    causality and existence itself. He fights by ripping holes in space-time, pulling
    enemies into alternate dimensions, or calling forth impossible paradoxes to eradicate
    them. He can foresee and negate any incoming attack, striking at the very concept
    of his opponents.
