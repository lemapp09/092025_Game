  characterDescription: The 'Puppeteer of Destiny,' Moirai sees and manipulates the
    threads of fate. Her mythic power allows her to alter the outcome of critical
    attacks, causing enemy abilities to fail or even backfire, dealing massive damage
    to their own ranks. She can also link the life forces of her allies, distributing
    incoming damage evenly to prevent any single hero from falling, or temporarily
    making an ally completely immune to all harm. She is an ethereal being, adorned
    with ancient, glowing runes, her movements precise and otherworldly, carrying
    a loom-like shield.
