  characterDescription: The 'Heart of the World,' Terra Prime is the living embodiment
    of the earth's resilience. Her legendary power allows her to reshape the battlefield
    itself, creating impassable terrain to funnel enemies, summoning ancient treants
    to fight by her side, and passively regenerating the health of all allies on
    ground she controls. Her presence makes an entire team unyielding. Her armor
    is an extension of the earth, adorned with living flora and ancient stones.
