  characterDescription: The 'Stone Heart,' Aethel is bound to ancient earth magic,
    allowing her to manifest earthen golems as temporary allies or turn her skin
    to unbreakable stone. Her rarity stems from her unique ability to convert incoming
    damage into a defensive boon for herself or a nearby ally, making her nearly
    impossible to dislodge. She wears armor made from magically reinforced rock and
    metal.
