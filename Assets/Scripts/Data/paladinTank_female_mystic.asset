  characterDescription: The Warden is a primal guardian whose power is drawn from
    the very earth itself. Her form is a fusion of living rock and celestial might,
    and she protects her allies with an impenetrable force field of pure, natural
    energy. She is not just a tank; she is an immovable force of nature.
