  characterDescription: Hailing from the deepest abysses, Krakon is a monstrous tank
    whose body is fused with primordial oceanic power. Her epic ability transforms
    her into a colossal sea beast, granting immense health regeneration and a crushing
    area-of-effect attack that pulls all enemies to her, allowing her to absorb damage
    and disrupt entire enemy formations. Her natural armor is like hardened coral
    and chitin.
