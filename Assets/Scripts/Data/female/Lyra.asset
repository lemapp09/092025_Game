  characterDescription: A former royal guard, Lyra commands the battlefield with
    a shimmering tower shield and tactical precision. Her uncommon rarity comes from
    her ability to boost the defense of nearby allies, making her a crucial linchpin
    in any formation. Her armor is polished and bears a faded crest.
