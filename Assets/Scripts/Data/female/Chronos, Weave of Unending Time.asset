  characterDescription: Existing beyond the fabric of the universe, Chronos is the
    ultimate master of temporal manipulation. She can compress eons into a moment
    for her allies, trap foes in infinite loops, and even split her consciousness
    across timelines to support her team from multiple points simultaneously, ensuring
    no defeat is final.
