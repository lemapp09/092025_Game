  characterDescription: Beyond even the Chronos Weaver, the Chronosoph is the architect
    of time itself. She can perfectly reconstruct any ally, returning them to their
    optimal state at any point in their existence, or even projecting them briefly
    into an uninjured future to avoid damage. Her understanding of causality makes
    her an absolute safeguard.
