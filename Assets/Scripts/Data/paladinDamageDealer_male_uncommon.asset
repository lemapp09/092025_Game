  characterDescription: A grim and focused warrior, Fenris prefers to let his blade
    do the talking. He moves with a predatory grace, striking with deadly precision
    before his enemies even know they are in danger. He is a testament to the old
    saying that a sharp mind is as important as a sharp sword.
