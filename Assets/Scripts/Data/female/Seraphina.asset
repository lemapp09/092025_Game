  characterDescription: A celestial protector touched by divine light, Seraphina
    floats gracefully across the battlefield, redirecting harm with angelic precision.
    Her unique, rare ability allows her to absorb a fatal blow for an ally once per
    combat, completely nullifying it, before re-engaging with renewed divine vigor.
    She wears ethereal, winged armor that glows faintly.
