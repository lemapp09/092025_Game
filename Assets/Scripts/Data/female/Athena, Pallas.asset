  characterDescription: The 'Goddess of War and Wisdom,' Pallas is the ultimate strategic
    and defensive force. Her legendary ability grants her total command over enemy
    targeting, forcing all attacks and abilities onto her for an extended duration
    while simultaneously boosting her team's damage significantly. She can also deploy
    an impenetrable Aegis shield that deflects all projectiles and magical attacks
    for a short period. She wears gleaming, divine armor, wielding a spear and the
    iconic Gorgon-emblazoned shield.
