  characterDescription: The 'Cosmic Bulwark,' Astraea is a celestial guardian whose
    very presence warps reality, making her nearly invulnerable. Her epic power allows
    her to create a miniature black hole that pulls all enemy attacks towards her,
    rendering her allies completely safe for a short duration, while also empowering
    her with cosmic energy for a devastating counter. Her armor is made of solidified
    starlight and constantly shifts with nebulae patterns.
