  characterDescription: The 'End of All Things,' Oblivion is an entity born from
    the entropy of the cosmos. Her mythic ability enables her to create an 'Event
    Horizon' that completely erases all incoming damage for her and her allies within
    its radius, while simultaneously dissolving enemy armor and defenses to zero.
    She can also briefly exist outside of time and space, becoming untargetable and
    untouchable, only to reappear to devastating effect. Her armor is an abyss-like
    void, absorbing all light, with a gauntlet that flickers with non-existence.
