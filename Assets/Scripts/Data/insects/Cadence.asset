  characterDescription: The mythical Grand Weaver, Cadence is an impossibly ancient
    orb weaver spider whose web is said to connect all destinies. She can subtly
    alter the probabilities of events, causing enemy attacks to miss or allied abilities
    to critically succeed. Her foresight is unparalleled.
