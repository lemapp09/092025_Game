  characterDescription: Known as the 'Iron Empress,' Valeriana is a veteran commander
    whose presence alone shifts the tide of battle. Wielding an enchanted runic shield,
    she can project a powerful aura that fortifies her entire team's defenses while
    drawing all enemy aggression to herself. Her rare ability allows her to temporarily
    become invulnerable, making her a true endgame tank. Her armor is regal and exceptionally
    crafted.
