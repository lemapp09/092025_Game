  characterDescription: The very spirit of shadows and cunning, Kage-no-Kami is a
    phantom blade master. He moves faster than the eye can follow, creating after-images
    and striking from impossible angles. His techniques are legendary, allowing him
    to sever life force directly and become completely untargetable for short durations.
