  characterDescription: The 'Flame of Rebirth,' Ignacia is an elemental force that
    defies death itself. Her legendary power allows her to self-immolate, dealing
    immense fire damage to all surrounding enemies while becoming temporarily invulnerable.
    Should she fall, she rises from her own ashes with full health and a massive
    defensive buff, capable of repeating this cycle once per battle. Her armor is
    forged from living flame and volcanic rock, constantly radiating intense heat.
