  characterDescription: A true 'Shield-Maiden of the Gods,' Brunhilde descends from
    Valhalla, bringing divine might to the mortal realm. Her epic ability grants
    her temporary divine invulnerability, during which she reflects all damage taken
    back to her attackers with amplified force, while also inspiring her allies to
    fight with renewed ferocity. She wields a legendary shield and spear, clad in
    ornate, feathered plate armor.
